Here is a suggested README.md for the ChainVerifier project:

# ChainVerifier 

ChainVerifier is a decentralized application for creating and verifying proofs of existence for digital files on the Stacks blockchain.

## Features

- Connect your Stacks wallet to get started 
- Create a new proof of existence by uploading a file 
- The SHA-256 hash of the file content is recorded on the Stacks blockchain 
- Verify an existing proof of existence by entering the transaction ID and uploading the same file 
- The file hash is compared against the hash recorded on chain to verify the proof

## How It Works

ChainVerifier works by computing a SHA-256 hash of the uploaded file's content. This hash is then recorded on the Stacks blockchain by sending a 0 STX transaction to the burn address with the hash included in the memo field.

To verify a proof of existence, the same process is followed to compute the hash of the uploaded file. This newly computed hash is compared against the hash stored on chain in the transaction memo. If the hashes match, the file is verified!

## Demo

You can try a live demo of ChainVerifier [here](https://URL).

## Run Locally

1. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. Start the app: 

```
npm start
```

3. Upload a file to create a new proof, then verify it by entering the transaction ID and re-uploading the same file.

## Tech Stack

ChainVerifier is built using:

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Stacks.js for blockchain integration

## License 

ChainVerifier is open source and available under the MIT license.

Let me know if you would like me to modify or expand the README in any way. I aimed to provide an overview of the project, the main features and functionality, a brief how-it-works section, setup/run instructions, and the tech stack used. Please feel free to adjust the wording as needed.
